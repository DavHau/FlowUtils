# FlowUtils

A Python library for performing common functions on flow cytometry data, 
such as compensation and transformations.

FlowUtils is part of a suite of Python libraries for analyzing flow c
ytometry data.  It was developed as an extension to the light-weight 
[FlowIO library](https://github.com/whitews/FlowIO). FlowIO reads and 
writes Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files, and has zero dependencies. 
For higher level interaction with flow cytometry data, including 
GatingML support, see the related 
[FlowKit project](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit).
